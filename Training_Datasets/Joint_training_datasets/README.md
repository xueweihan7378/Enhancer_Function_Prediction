## Joint training datasets included enhancer-gene links from more than one cell type out of HepG2, K562, and HCT116. 

They were generated by pooling individual cell-type-specific training data. 
Thus, there was a total of four joint datasets, HepG2+K562, HepG2+HCT116, K562+HCT116, and HepG2+K562+HCT116.
