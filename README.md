## This is the pipeline of generating features for machine learning prediction

- Four cell types were involved in the training datasets that have the information of true positve or true negative enhancer-gene links
* HepG2
* K562
* HCT116
* MCF7

- Four cell types were used to validate the machine learning algorithms and get the probability of being a positive enhancer-gene link for each candidate.
* GM12878
* H1
* HeLa-S3
* SK-N-SH
